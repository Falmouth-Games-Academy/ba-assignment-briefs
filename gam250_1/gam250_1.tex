\section*{Introduction}

\begin{marginquote}
If we knew what it was we were doing, it would not be called research, would it?

\end{marginquote}

In this assignment you will be developing your research skills in order to expand your programming knowledge. This research will inform the direction of Assignment 2 and even feed into your 2nd year group project.

Research is a key skill in any programmers toolbox and during your career as a Games Developer you will encounter problems that will require a significant amount of research.

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
	\item \textbf{Provide} a project proposal, this should contain the following:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Project Title
		\item Project Description
		\item Project Justification
		\item List of key sources  (a minimum of 5, including 3 Journals) 
	\end{enumerate}
    \item A \textbf{draft} of your research
    \item A \textbf{fully referenced document} which contains your research
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Part A}

Part A is \textbf{single summative submission}. This is \textbf{individual} work will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail: 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Reasonable justification for the project
	\item At least 5 sources included (minimum of 3 Journals)
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part A, you should submit a document to the assignment area of the learning space by 

You will receive informal feedback via email from your \textbf{tutor}.

\subsection*{Part B}

Part B is a \textbf{single summative submission}. This is \textbf{individual} work will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail: 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Varied list of references
	\item A reasonable standard of English
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part B, you should submit a document to the assignment area of the learning space by 

You will receive \textbf{immediate informal} feedback from your \textbf{tutor}.


\subsection*{Part C}

Part C is a \textbf{single formal submission}. This is \textbf{individual} work will be assessed on a \textbf{threshold} basis. The following criteria are used to determine a pass or fail: 

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
	\item Submission is timely;
	\item Varied list of references
	\item A reasonable standard of English
	\item Incorporated feedback from Part B
\end{enumerate}

To complete Part C, you should submit a document to the assignment area of the learning space by 

You will receive \textbf{formal} feedback on the learning space

\section*{Additional Guidance}
Research is one of the key skills you can develop as a programmer, during you career you will encounter problems which you can't solve straight away. This will require you to go away and carry out research to gather the knowledge to give you the tools to solve the problem. In addition to this, research is simply not about parroting what has been written before, you have to critically analyse and then adapt to your own Use Case.

At Falmouth University we use the Harvard Referencing style, please ensure that you use this  for all references. You can receive support for this format from your tutor and the University Library - \url{http://library.fxplus.ac.uk/library/how/referencing}. You are also welcome to use tools such as RefWorks, Mendely, or Zotero to organise your references, these tools will often allow you to export a reading list in a Harvard style which can then be incorporated into your report.

Writing takes practice so make sure that you take feedback from your tutor and incorpate the changes into a new version of the document. You should also consider getting someone else to proof read your report, it is very easy to make mistakes and not notice them when you are too close to the work.

\section*{FAQ}

\begin{itemize}
	\item 	\textbf{What is the deadline for this assignment?} \\ 
    		Falmouth University policy states that deadlines must only be specified on the MyFalmouth system.
    		
	\item 	\textbf{What should I do to seek help?} \\ 
    		You can email your tutor for informal clarifications. For informal feedback, make a pull request on GitHub. 
    		
    	\item 	\textbf{Is this a mistake?} \\ 	
    		If you have discovered an issue with the brief itself, the source files are available at: \\
