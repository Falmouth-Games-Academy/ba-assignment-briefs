Virtual reality has the potential to immerse users in new worlds, allowing them to embody new forms and interact with their surroundings in novel ways. With recent advancements in haptic controllers and the proliferation of VR modelling tools, it seems likely that in the future we will see more game artist working in VR to sculpt and model assets for games. Tools such as Quill, Medium and Tilt Brush provide intuitive ways to interface with design tools. These tools priorities expression and creativity over precision and photorealism. This assignment asks you to experiment with the creative potential of VR without getting hung up on technical pipelines and complex tools. For this assignment, you are required to submit a portfolio of experimental VR assets and one final VR artefact: a virtual world to be experienced in VR built using original assets from your portfolio. \textbf{ You are only allowed to create assets whilst in VR.} You may use any VR tools you choose although the tuition will focus on Tilt Brush and corresponding Unity pipelines. 

This assignment is formed of several parts:

\begin{enumerate}[label=(\Alph*)]
    \item \textbf{Conceive}, of a virtual world based on a cultural artefact such as a poem, piece of art or song lyric and then:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{Research} the chosen cultural artefact 
    		\item \textbf{Collect} references in the form of mood boards;
    		\item \textbf{Sketch} out the world focusing on the assets required to build it;
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Create}, a portfolio of assets and experiments based on the work carried out for part A:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{Experiment} with different VR modelling tools and techniques;
    		\item \textbf{Collate} the work in a manner that is easy to navigate such as through SketchFab or as blog content. 
    		\item \textbf{Present}, as an individual, your work in progress and receive feedback from tutors and peers
	\end{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Construct} a world using the portfolio of assets:
    	\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    		\item \textbf{Integrate} the tools and techniques evidenced in assignment 1.
    		\item \textbf{Enhance} the assets using tools inside Unity Game Engine
    		\item \textbf{Design} a sound scape to compliment the world
    		\item \textbf{Consider} adding multi-player. This is a stretch goal and is not required by the assignment
	\end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Assignment Submission}
This assignment is an \textbf{individual} task. You should submit a zip folder of your work that includes a readme.txt  that outlines the submission directory structure and provides \textbf{links to any work that is too large} for the Learning Space size constraint (1GB). Your submission should include sub-folders for:
\begin{enumerate}[label=\roman*.]
    	\item \textbf{Research} - any supporting research relevant to the assignment
    	\item \textbf{Experiments} - any supporting experimentation relevant to the assignment
    	\item \textbf{Design} - any supporting design work relevant to the assignment
    	\item \textbf{Final} - a video of the final experience
\end{enumerate}

\section*{FAQ}

\begin{itemize}
	\item 	\textbf{What is the deadline for this assignment?} \\ 
    		Falmouth University policy states that deadlines must only be specified on the MyFalmouth system.
    		
	\item 	\textbf{What should I do to seek help?} \\ 
    		You can email your tutor for informal clarifications. For informal feedback, make a pull request on GitHub.
